# Project Report - Ball Rush
#### Problem Faced :
Games fascinate me.
Not only me. Everyone.
So I came up with the idea of MAKING a game to experience the joy while I design my own world .  

#### Project Idea :
My idea was to implemnt a simple game, like Temple Run, but, of course, with much simpler graphics and just some basic functionalities.

#### Tech Stack:
I used the Unity game development engine and some basic C# programming to make this game.

#### Progress of the project:
The basic functionalities of the project are working just fine, so I like to think that it's been finished, although much more things can be still added to the game.

#### Future Prospects:
The basic things are working just fine, but the game can be developed much more in the future. For example, we can add a characyer instead of a ball, and the obstacles, the path, the pits, coins and powerups can be made much more realistic.
Just like Temple Run ;)
